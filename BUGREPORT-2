A sample of bug report for issue: Petstore Orders API Tests › Place a new order for a pet invalid data

Description: 
    The POST /store/order endpoint in the Petstore Orders API does not return the expected error response when provided with invalid or malformed data. 
    Instead, it either accepts the data incorrectly or returns a generic error message, leading to potential issues with data integrity and API usability.

Steps to Reproduce:
    Use postman or run script to send an endpoint: POST https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/store/order
    Request Body (example of invalid data):
    {   
        id: -2,
        petId: 1.1,
        quantity: -9,
        shipDate: new Date().toISOString(),
        status: 'placed',
        complete: true,
    }

Expected Result:
    The API should respond with a 400 Bad Request status code.
    The response body should provide a detailed error message indicating which fields are invalid and why.

Actual Result:
    Request is successful and returns 200 status code.
