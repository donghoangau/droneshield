Test Plan for Login Functionality

Objective
  The objective of this test plan is to validate the functionality, security, and usability of the Login feature in the website to ensure that users can authenticate and access the system securely and efficiently.

Scope
  The scope of this test plan includes:

    Validation of the login page UI and functionality.
    Verification of the login process using valid and invalid credentials and system should handle any error exception.
    Security testing for the login feature.
    Performance testing to ensure the login process works efficiently under high volumns.

    Test environment is set up and ready.
Exit criteria

    All planned test cases have been executed.
    All critical/major bugs have been fixed and retested.
    Test summary report is prepared and approved.

Test Environment
    Devices: Desktop, Mobile, Tablets
    Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
    Operating Systems: Windows, macOS, Android, iOS
    Network Conditions: High-speed connection, low-speed connection, no internet
    
Test Data

    Valid Credentials: A set of provided valid usernames and passwords.
    Invalid Credentials: A set of provided invalid usernames and passwords
    Boundary Values: Usernames and passwords of varying lengths and character sets.
    
Test Cases
    Verify that the login page is displayed correctly on different devices and browsers.
    Check that all UI elements, such as input fields, labels, buttons, and links, are present and properly aligned.

Functional Testing

    Valid Login: Verify that the user can successfully log in using valid credentials.
    Validate if a user is able to login in a different session.
    Invalid Login: Test with incorrect username and/or password to ensure appropriate error messages are shown.
    Empty Fields: Check the behavior when the login button is clicked without entering any data.
    Password Masking: Ensure the password field masks input characters.
    Session Management: Validate that users are logged out automatically after a period of inactivity.

Boundary Testing

    Test with maximum and minimum lengths for the username and password fields.
    Verify the behavior with special characters in the username and password.

Usability Testing

    Check the clarity and comprehensibility of error messages.
    Verify that the login page is easy to use and navigate in responsive mode.
    Ensure keyboard navigation works as expected without using mouse (Tab order, Enter key behavior).

Security Testing

    SQL Injection: Attempt to use SQL Injection in the login fields to ensure the system is secure.
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Test for XSS vulnerabilities.
    Force Attack Prevention: Verify if the system locks out the user after multiple failed login attempts.
    Data Encryption: Ensure that passwords are encrypted before being sent over the network.
    Secure Cookies: Verify that secure cookies are used for session management.
    
Performance Testing

    Check the load time of the login page under different network conditions.
    Perform stress testing to ensure the login process works efficiently when multiple users are trying to log in simultaneously.

Compatibility Testing

    Verify the login functionality across different browsers and operating systems.

Key Risks
Security Risks

    Repeated password guessing attempts.
    SQL Injection: Database manipulation through input fields.
    XSS & CSRF: Vulnerabilities that can expose user data.
    Session Hijacking: Risk of unauthorized session access.
    Weak Password Storage: Using poor hashing or storing passwords in plain text.

Usability Risks

    Complex Passwords
    Confusing Error Messages

Performance Risks

    Slow Login Process: Affects user experience under heavy load.
    Server Downtime: Prevents access and disrupts service.
    Network Latency: Delays due to location distance.

Mitigation Strategies
    Use strong encryption and secure protocols.
    Implement account lockouts and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    Regularly test for vulnerabilities.
    Optimize server performance and ensure compatibility.
    Follow secure practices for password reset and data privacy.
